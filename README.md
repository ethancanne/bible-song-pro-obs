## Feedback Backend

To let the in-app Feedback form create GitHub issues directly, run the bundled backend:

1. Set environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` = a GitHub token with issue write access
   - `GITHUB_REPO` = `Johnbatey/bible-song-pro-obs` (or another `owner/repo`)
   - Optional: `FEEDBACK_PORT` = backend port, default `8787`
2. Start the server:
   - `npm run feedback:server`
3. Start the app and use the Feedback tab. The public build uses the bundled default feedback endpoint automatically.

Health check:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/health`

The backend keeps the GitHub token on the server side and returns the created issue URL to the app.

## Feedback Worker

For public deployment without keeping your PC running, use the Cloudflare Worker in [feedback-worker](feedback-worker).

Quick path:

1. `cd feedback-worker`
2. `npm install`
3. `npx wrangler login`
4. `npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN`
5. `npm run deploy`
6. If you change the deployed Worker in future, update the default feedback endpoint in the panel source.
   - Current deployed Worker: `https://bible-song-pro-feedback.johnbatey-bsp.workers.dev/api/github-feedback`

The Worker setup is documented in [feedback-worker/README.md](feedback-worker/README.md).
